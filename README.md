* The game is scalable and therefore can be used on multiple devices.
* The game supports 2 to 6 players.
* You can play against a ghost player.
* The grid is scalable up to 10 by 10 grid, which can be also non-symmetric.
* The number of symbols in sequence for a win can be also adjusted (or turned off).
