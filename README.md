This app is a cross-platform Tic-Tac-Toe game, which was originally developed in Tkinter but now has been converted to Kivy for Android support.

* The game is scalable and therfore can be used on multiple devices.
* The game supports 2 to 5 players (more can be added but only 3 symbols are supported).
* The grid is scalable up to 10 by 10 grid (can be non-symmetric).
* The number of symbols in a row for a win can be also adjusted.


## For future development

* Might add an option to play against some AI of sorts ;).
* Need to replace the last number in "Symbols in Series (x, y, z):" to "Disabled".
